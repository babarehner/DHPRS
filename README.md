DHPRS stands for Daily Home Practice Recording Sheet (Copyright 2018 Carolyn Fisher).  This app is developed to allow a person to enter their daily records into an android phone.  It uses a SQLite database to store all information. A provision is made to share one record at a time using Android Share.
 
There are two major screens. One is a List View which has a date, Practice Type and length of each daily practice.  New records are added by clicking on a floating action bar.
 
There is also an Edit View which allows the user to save or edit a daily record.  Buttons are used for easy date and time entry.  Spinners are used for several entries to save the user from having to use the keyboard.  A Comments section allows the user the enter multiline comments. To save a record click on the checkmark on the top of the screen.

Since Practice Aid has options from a spinner there are two screens that allow you to Edit Practice Aids.  Edit Practice Aids is reached from the main starting screen by clicking on the Options Menu.  This brings up a list of current Practice Aids. 
Clicking on each Practice Aid will navigate to a screen that lists one Practice Aid. Here you can edit or delete a Practice Aid.

In the past I've been advised to have a disclaimer for my projects.  It sounds real scary, though I endeavor to make all my projects behave nicely and would never knowingly ship junkware.  Though it remains to be said as a part time developer I am limited by time and resource constraints.
